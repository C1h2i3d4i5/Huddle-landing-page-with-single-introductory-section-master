## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Font Library
- [Font Awesome 5 Fonts](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon Library

### What I learned

- When using media queries, make sure to set the max-width to something more inclusive for all ranges of devices
- Always specify language at the header of your html code
- Use 'Alt' attribute with images 
- Semantic html is good but plain divs are too!
- When using Flex-basis, make sure any image in it has a width of 100%
- Apply background-colors to the body tag if it's going to take up the entire space of the web page

```css
  Some CSS code I'm proud of
    .container{
    margin-left: 50px;
    margin-right: 50px;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  .col-1{
    flex-basis: 60%;
  }
  .col-1 img{
    width: 100%;
  }
  .col-2{
    flex-basis: 40%;
  }
```

### Continued development

- Improve my skills in Flexbox
- Improve my skills in mobile first design

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com//) - This helped me to find out what values certain selectors took. I really it's easy to understand concept definitions and will use it going forward.
